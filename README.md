# SnakeAndLadder
I created a snake and ladder game using Javafx .
in this i used DSA to build board and to move the players according to the random number between 1 to 6.
Created a classes like player class, board class, dice class to operate game and to do operations of objects of game.
at the end i created a .exe file to easily download using inosetup .
